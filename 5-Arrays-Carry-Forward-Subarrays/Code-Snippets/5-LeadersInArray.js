/* ================ Leaders in an array
Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.

    Constraints : 
        1 <= N <= 10^5
        1 <= A[i] <= 10^8
    Input param A : integer[N]
    return : integer[] - Return an integer array denoting all the leader elements of the array.
    Example:
        Input:
            A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
        Output:
            [17, 2, 5] -  
                Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
                Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
                Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
                So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.
